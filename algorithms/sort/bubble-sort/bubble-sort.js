/**
 * Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, 
 * compares adjacent pairs and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted. 
 * The algorithm, which is a comparison sort, is named for the way smaller or larger elements "bubble" to the top of the list.
 * 
 * Bubble sort has a worst-case and average complexity of Ðž(n^2).
 * 
 * Although the algorithm is simple, it is too slow and impractical for most problems even when compared to insertion sort.
 * Bubble sort can be practical if the input is in mostly sorted order with some out-of-order elements nearly in position.
